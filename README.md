# my-blog-diagrams
Graphs, Sequence Diagrams, etc. for my blog - made from tools like Graphviz and plantuml

The howto_[diagram_tool].md files give starting point instructions for the relevant diagram_tool.

watch.sh uses inotify-tools to watch for file changes and then will run regen_all.sh when the source files are updated.

regen_all.sh should be a series of all the build commands for each diagram.
